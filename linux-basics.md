## Create a Folder

Create a single folder:

```bash
mkdir myfolder
```

Create nested folders in one command:

```bash
mkdir -p projects/2025/demo
```

## Display Your Current Path

Show the full path of your current directory:

```bash
pwd
# Example output:
# /home/username/projects
```

## What Commands to Use

Some core commands you will use all the time:

```bash
pwd       # show current path
ls        # list files and folders
ls -l     # detailed list
ls -a     # show hidden files
cd NAME   # change directory
cd ..     # go up one level
clear     # clear the terminal screen
man ls    # open manual for 'ls'
ls --help # quick help for 'ls'
```

## Write Text to a File

Overwrite a file with new text:

```bash
echo "First line" > notes.txt
# notes.txt will contain:
# First line
```

Append text to the end of a file:

```bash
echo "Another line" >> notes.txt
# Appends "Another line" as a new line to notes.txt
```

Create a file and type many lines (end with Ctrl+D):

```bash
cat > notes.txt
# This is line 1
# This is line 2
# (Ctrl+D to save and exit)
```

## How to Edit Text in a File

Use a simple terminal editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano notes.txt
# Basic nano shortcuts:
#   Ctrl+O  save (Write Out)
#   Enter   confirm filename
#   Ctrl+X  exit
```

(If `nano` is not installed, use another editor like `vim`.)

## Copy a File

Copy a file to a new file name:

```bash
cp source.txt backup.txt
```

Copy a file into a folder:

```bash
cp notes.txt backup/notes.txt
```

Copy a folder and all its contents:

```bash
cp -r myfolder myfolder-backup
```

## Move a File

Move a file into another folder:

```bash
mv notes.txt backup/
```

Rename a file (same folder):

```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

Move and rename at the same time:

```bash
mv notes.txt archive/notes-2025.txt
```

## Delete a File

Delete a single file:

```bash
rm notes.txt
```

Ask for confirmation before deleting:

```bash
rm -i notes.txt
# Prompts: rm: remove regular file 'notes.txt'? y
```

Delete multiple files:

```bash
rm file1.txt file2.txt
```

⚠️ **Warning:** `rm` does not go to a recycle bin. Be careful.

## Delete a Folder

Delete an empty folder:

```bash
rmdir emptyfolder
```

Delete a folder and everything inside it:

```bash
rm -r myfolder
```

Ask for confirmation on each file and folder:

```bash
rm -ri myfolder
# Prompts for each item before deletion
```

⚠️ **Warning:** `rm -r` is dangerous. Double-check the folder name before running it.

## How to Use curl

Basic `curl` usage to show a webpage in the terminal:

```bash
curl https://example.com
# Prints the HTML to your terminal
```

Download a file with its original name:

```bash
curl -O https://example.com/file.zip
# Saves as: file.zip (original filename)
```

Download and save as a custom name:

```bash
curl -o myfile.zip https://example.com/file.zip
# Saves as: myfile.zip
```

Call an API endpoint (GET request):

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/status
# Example (abbreviated) response might be JSON
```

Send data with a POST request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "user", "password": "secret"}'
# Sends JSON payload to the API
```
